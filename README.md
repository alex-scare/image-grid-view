# [Image Grid View](https://github.com/alex-scare/image-grid-view)

by [Alex P.](https://github.com/alex-scare)

`ImageGridView` is a Flutter widget that displays a grid of images with an option to view the images full screen. 

The widget takes a list of image URLs and a title for the full screen view, and automatically arranges the images in a grid with a maximum of 9 visible images. Additional images are displayed in the last grid item as a counter. Users can tap on an image to view it full screen. 

The package includes various customizable UI components to make it easy to integrate with your app.
